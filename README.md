# Lambda CSV Data Processor

This project demonstrates the use of an AWS Lambda function (running locally with LocalStack) to process CSV data. The Lambda function receives CSV data as an event, filters rows based on salary thresholds, and calculates name counts. It is intended to be used in conjunction with a client application for uploading CSV files and invoking the Lambda function.
